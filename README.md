# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
<br>
This project uses the Diabetic Retinopathy (IDR) dataset to classify the severity of diabetic retinopathy using the Random Forest algorithm in Python. The dataset includes images and features extracted from retinal scans to predict the stages of diabetic retinopathy. Using libraries like pandas, sklearn, and image processing tools, the project preprocesses the data, trains a Random Forest model, and evaluates its performance in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy.
