# Diabetic Retinopathy and Messidor
This project leverages two important diabetic retinopathy datasets, Diabetic Retinopathy (IDR) and MESSIDOR, to classify the severity of diabetic retinopathy using machine learning algorithms. The IDR dataset is used with the Random Forest algorithm to predict the stages of diabetic retinopathy based on retinal scan features. Meanwhile, the MESSIDOR dataset is utilized with the Naive Bayes classifier to diagnose diabetic retinopathy and its severity. The project involves preprocessing the datasets, training the models using sklearn, and evaluating their performance to accurately classify diabetic retinopathy based on extracted image features.
